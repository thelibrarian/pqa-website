  <i>Are practice tests available?</i>
</p>
<p>
  No, there are not practice tests other than the sample questions shown on
  this website.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  <i>Are the tests available in languages other than English?</i>
</p>
<p>
  The tests are currently used in some countries where English is not the first
  language. When so used the questions have been translated into the local
  language.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  <i>Can I use the tests for my own research?</i>
</p>
<p>
  Interested academic researchers based at recognised institutions are invited
  to make contact and submit a brief proposal of their intended research
  <a href="mailto:Miles.Bore@newcastle.edu.au">to the PQA team</a> for
  consideration. Please note that a per capita charge will apply if test use
  is approved.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  <i>If my research proposal is accepted will I be given the scoring guide for
    the tests?</i>
</p>
<p>
  No. All test scoring and result reporting is conducted securely by the PQA
  team.

<p>
  <i>My institution is interested in using PQA to select our students for
    health professional courses. What do I need to do?</i>
</p>
<p>
  Student selection personnel based at recognised institutions are invited to
  <a href="mailto:Miles.Bore@newcastle.edu.au">make contact with the PQA team</a>
  and provide details of their request for consideration. Please note that a
  per capita charge will apply if test use is approved.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  <i>Can the on-line PQA test be taken at home?</i>
</p>
<p>
  No. To maintain security of test content, and to be assured of who is
  actually taking the test, all testing is conducted under approved supervision
  at approved locations.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  <i>How are PQA test results used to select students?</i>
</p>
<p>
  We do not release details of the manner in which PQA test results are used in
  the selection procedure because this may encourage strategic rather than
  honest responding to questions.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  <i>How can I ensure that I get good PQA test results?</i>
</p>
<p>
  For MAT: by carefully considering the questions and applying sound logic to
  solving them.
</p>
<p>
  For the other tests: by being entirely honest, and not attempting to guess
  what answer is favoured by the tester. It is in your best interest to answer
  honestly as any indication of lying would obviously compromise your results.
</p>

<p>
  <i>I have taken the PQA tests before and didn't get in to the course of my
  choice. Does this mean that I failed one or more of the PQA test sections?</i>
</p>
<p>
  PQA testing is not based on a pass/fail model, and anyway PQA score profiles
  are invariably only one component of an institutions selection procedure.
  Remember also that failure to gain admission to many courses is often a
  consequence of high competition for few places rather than poor performance
  in one or other of the selection components.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  <i>Is it likely that I will improve my PQA test scores if I take the tests
    again?</i>
</p>
<p>
  Our experience is that the scores of repeat test takers does not change
  substantially, and might be worse in some cases.
