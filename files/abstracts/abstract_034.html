<p>BROADENING THE CRITERIA FOR MEDICAL RADIATION SCIENCE STUDENT SELECTION</p>
<p>MR Bore, S Dempsey, D Lyall, DA Powis</p>
<p>Faculty of Health, the University of Newcastle,</p>
<p>Australia</p>
<p><em>Context</em>: In selecting students for health professional programs it is increasingly acknowledged that in addition to prior academic achievement there is a need to seek evidence for the abilities and personal qualities of applicants that may be required by the specific health profession.</p>
<p><em>Objectives</em>: To determine the specific abilities and personal qualities required of excellence in the practice in the relevant professional domains of Medical Radiation Science (MRS).</p>
<p><em>Methods:</em> A focus group, consisting of academic MRS staff, modified and added to a questionnaire originally developed from a focus group of Occupational Therapy academic staff. The questionnaire was sent to senior MRS practitioners throughout Australia and 213 were returned for analysis. Respondents were asked to rate 40 specific abilities and qualities (referred to as '<em>elements</em>') on a 5 point scale ranging from <em>Essential to Irrelevant</em> and to provide comments and additional elements.</p>
<p><em>Main Outcomes</em>: No major differences were found between the ratings provided by practitioners from the MRS professional domains of Diagnostic Radiography, Radiation Therapy and Nuclear Medicine. Factor analysis indicated the existence of three orthogonal factors underlying the questionnaire data: <em>Treat others professionally and ethically, Engage with and be open to others</em>, and <em>Problem solving ability</em>. Qualitative analysis of respondents' comments provided similar themes: the need for <em>Professional Competence </em>(knowledge and abilities), <em>Ethical Behaviour</em> (orientation toward patients and colleagues/other health professionals), the need for a <em>Technology and a People Orientation</em>, and that MRS should be the <em>First Choice</em> of MRS students and not a second choice to other professional degrees such as medicine.</p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em>: Senior Medical Radiation Scientists identified professionalism, ethical behaviour, engagement and openness to others, intrinsic motivation and an orientation to people and technology as non-academic qualities required for excellence in the practice of the relevant MRS profession.</p>
<p>SELECTING MEDICAL STUDENTS: DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SCHOOL LEAVER AND OLDER APPLICANTS</p>
<p>Bore MR, Powis DA, Munro D, Kerridge I.</p>
<p><em>Context:</em> Since 1997 a research team at the University of Newcastle has been developing psychometric measures of personal qualities identified as being important in the context of the practice of medicine: reasoning ability, moral orientation, empathy and narcissism. Before the measures could be used as selection instruments, the influence of demographic (age, gender) and other confounding variables need to be evaluated.</p>
<p><em>Purpose:</em> To examine differences between school-leaver and older applicants to medical schools on three Personal Quality Assessment (PQA) measures.</p>
<p><em>Procedures:</em> School leaver and university graduate applicants to medical schools in Australia and the UK (n = 2111) completed three PQA measures: the Mental Agility Test (MAT; Munro and Bore), a measure of moral orientation (the Mojac Scale; Bore) and the NACE scale (Munro) which quantifies Narcissism, Aloofness, Confidence and Empathy. The tests were scored and score differences based on age, gender and applicant type were analysed for statistical differences.</p>
<p><em>Results:</em> The major significant differences found were that older applicants tended to have lower reasoning ability and a more Communitarian (rather than Libertarian) moral orientation. A weak tendency was observed for females to be more Communitarian, Empathic and less Narcissistic than males who were more Libertarian, Narcissistic and less Empathic. After controlling for Age, no significant differences were found between school-leaver applicants and applicants with a university degree on any of the measures.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion:</em> The gender and age differences observed in reasoning ability, empathy and narcissism reflect the findings generally reported in the literature. The differences in moral orientation could be either a developmental effect or the relative absence of Libertarian oriented applicants in the university graduate samples. Further research is required to determine whether Libertarian oriented people tend to choose a profession other than medicine.</p>
<p>DETERMINING OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY STUDENT SELECTION CRITERIA: ABILITIES AND PERSONAL QUALITIES IN PRACTICE</p>
<p>Lyons M, Bore M, Mackenzie L &amp; Powis DA (2003)</p>
<p><em>Context:</em> Students entering professional preparation programs in occupational therapy [OT] are typically selected on the basis of academic performance alone. As an adjunct to student selection on academic performance, semi-structured interviews have been adopted by several of the University of Newcastle's health professional programs, including OT and medicine. In the case of the University's medical program, testing for specific abilities and personal qualities has been combined with interviewing and academic indicators, with good outcomes relative to other Australian medical schools. The goal of any educational OT program is to produce the 'best possible' graduates who possess the knowledge, abilities and personal qualities for excellence in the practice of OT.</p>
<p><em>Purpose:</em> To determine what specific abilities and personal qualities are considered by practitioners to be most important in the practice of OT with a view to including these in selection testing procedures.</p>
<p><em>Procedures:</em> <u>Stage 1</u>: From a focus group of Newcastle OT academics, a list of desirable and undesirable abilities and traits of OT practitioners was identified.</p>
<p><u>Stage 2</u>: From this list a questionnaire was developed and completed by 175 OT professionals who rated, added to, and commented on the abilities and traits listed in the questionnaire.</p>
<p><em>Results:</em> The most highly rated <em>abilities</em> were in communication and problem-solving; while the <em>qualities</em> of respecting others, self-responsibility, and ethical orientation were rated highest. The results suggest that students who have the ability to reason logically, who tend to value individual autonomy, and who can relate easily to people might excel in the OT profession.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion:</em> This research highlights abilities and personal qualities that could be added to current selection criteria to assist in identifying high quality candidates for entry into OT education.</p>
