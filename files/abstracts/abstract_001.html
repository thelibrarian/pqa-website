<p><strong>The psychology of morality: A Libertarian-Communitarian dimension and a dissonance model of moral decision making.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MR Bore Doctoral Dissertation 2001</strong></p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>For the past four decades (1960-2000), the dominant psychological approach to moral behaviour has been that of Lawrence Kohlberg's cognitive-developmental stage theory of moral reasoning. This thesis shows, however, that the theoretical and empirical links between reasoning stages and moral behaviour is weak, and that the protocols for measuring moral reasoning actually measure post-decisional justifications. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a reliable, valid model and measure of moral decision making. The model presented in this thesis proposes that a Libertarian-Communitarian dimension of moral orientation mediates the perception and processing of moral stimuli, while the psychological discomfort of cognitive dissonance motivates moral decisional behaviour and accounts for individual differences in affective experience in a moral dilemma context.</p>
<p>A psychometric measure of the Libertarian-Communitarian dimension was developed in order to test the model. A total of 8,436 applicants to medical school, and students attending medical school, in Australia, Israel, New Zealand, and Fiji, plus a small number of psychology undergraduate students and medical clinicians from Australia, participated in the research program. The measure was found to have consistently high internal reliability and acceptable test/retest reliability. Correlational, factor analytical and qualitative analyses found support for the validity of the measure, and of the Libertarian-Communitarian dimension and the role of dissonance in moral decision making. When combined with an interpersonal <em>Detached versus Involved</em> dimension, the theory and research presented in this thesis provides a viable alternative approach to the psychology of moral behaviour. Additionally, the findings suggest that a moral dimension is one of three possible supertraits of personality: Extraversion, Neuroticism, and <em>Individual Freedom versus Duty to the Group.</em> This interpretation is supported by the existing literature on personality, social psychology and evolutionary psychology and suggests that an <em>Individual Freedom versus Duty to the Group</em> supertrait underlies a number of psychological constructs found in these domains.</p>
