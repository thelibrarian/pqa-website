<p>Presentations at 8<sup>th</sup> Australasian Conference on Personality &amp; Individual Differences.</p>

<p><strong><em>Personality and the Keyes and Lopez (2002) Complete State Model of mental health</em></strong></p>
<p>Although advances have been made with talk and drug therapies that have focused on reducing symptoms of mental illness new approaches are needed both to promote mental health and prevent mental illness. For these reasons, Keyes and Lopez (2002) propose the integration of the dimensions of mental health (subjective well-being) and mental illness (psychological distress) into a Complete State Model of Mental Health (CSMMH). The current study empirically tested the CSMMH and its association with the personality traits of the Big 5, resilience, coping styles, and hope. Two hundred and forty one first year psychology students completed a battery of self-report questionnaires. The results showed that optimal mental health is associated with a personality profile of high Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and lower levels of Neuroticism. Additionally, high levels of mental health were positively related to the protective factors of resilience, hope, and task-oriented coping styles. Significant differences between the four 'types' defined by the CSMMH suggest that the model might have value in clinical interventions and that personality might usefully indicate the need for and type of early intervention.</p>

<p><strong><em>Integrating adaptive and pathological traits: The role of the Dark Triad</em></strong></p>
<p>The Five Factor Model (FFM), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM; APA, 1994) defined personality disorders and the Dark Triad, consisting of Narcissism, Machiavellianism and Psychopathy, may share relationships that allow a more informative conceptualisation of negative personality traits. The current study aimed to explore the relationships between the Dark Triad, the domains and facets of the FFM, and those of the Personality Disorders. The second aim was to include maladaptive and dysfunctional personality styles to better describe the personality profile of normal populations. Personality questionnaires measuring the three constructs of interest were administered to 241 first year psychology students. Principal Components Analysis revealed a four component solution, with the FFM domains loading onto each component. Given the constructs loading onto each, the four components were labelled Emotionality, Extraverted Risk-Taking, Antisociality, and Inflexibility respectively. It was concluded that the relationships between the Dark Triad, the FFM and the Personality Disorders can be used to describe the maladaptive and dysfunctional styles present in normal personality profiles.</p>

<p><strong><em>Validating the 'Steady, Sane and Nice' model with medical students</em></strong></p>
<p>At ACPID 2007 we presented a model of important predictors of successful medical student performance, based on several years of work in the field (Munro, Bore &amp; Powis, 2008, in Boag, Personality Down Under). Three predictors were identified, formally identified as conscientiousness, psychological resilience and involvement ('steady, sane and nice'). Predictive validity evidence for non-cognitive tests has been difficult to obtain for medical students and doctors, largely because medical schools do not routinely collect suitable criterion data, but rely largely on academic exams and pass/fail assessments of clinical competence. We report here initial findings from a project run by a collaborating researcher who has collected data from a range of personality and ability tests (including PQA tests) and also academic examination results, professional evaluations and PBL tutor assessments for a cohort of medical students over two years. Though strong relationships between test results and medical school performance are difficult to find, the pattern suggests that various components of the ability and personality profiles may predict academic examinations, clinical performance and classroom behaviours. The methodological difficulties interpreting the complex relationships will be discussed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Referees' reports can be very reliable, but also completely invalid</em></strong></p>
<p>Referees' reports on an applicant are a frequently employed component of selection procedures, and the use of rating scales within these is also common. However, despite a constant stream of reports on individual scales (mainly clinical) in recent years, there appears to be very little on the reliability or validity of such rating scales for selection in general, and in particular the use of several judges. The present study was undertaken to investigate the reliability and potential validity of a structured report form devised to aid the selection of candidates for postgraduate medical training. 585 candidates each had three or four assessors return ratings of their communication skills, interpersonal skills and professional competence using a 54-item appraisal form. Although the inventory per se showed a high degree of internal consistency and generalisability, agreement between assessors was nearly zero, as if different people had been assessed rather than single candidates. The methodological and practical implications are discussed.</p>
