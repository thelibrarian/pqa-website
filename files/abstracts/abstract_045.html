<p>Models of personality: Are we factor-bound?</p>
<p>Almost all the models of personality in current use that have been formulated on the basis of multiple scales (or items) are based on factor analyses. This is despite the facts that (i) different factoring methods can produce markedly different structures, (ii) factor analysis invariably proceeds by extracting dimensions of progressively smaller size from the same correlation or covariance matrices, ignoring the possibility that different substructures could exist at different locii in hyperspace, and (iii) our purposes in analysing the data vary widely, from trying to gain a simple understanding of a particular sample, to choosing items for a new test or tests for a battery, and to formulating universal personality theories. Alternative analytic procedures are available, including cluster analysis for variables. The presentation will illustrate these different approaches using a number of available data sets.</p>

<p>Selecting out on the basis of potential unethical behaviour.</p>
<p>Many suggestions have been made in the medical education literature over the years about the desiderata for medical students and practitioners, ranging from such traits/skills as empathy and communication skills to resistance to fatigue and stress. There are many problems with attempting to select students on such criteria, not least being the difficulty of formulating a practicable battery of valid tests. It can also be argued that many of the required qualities should be deliberately taught, or can be passively acquired, during medical education. The approach advocated in this paper is that, rather than focusing on selecting students on the basis of 'good' characteristics (on which most applicants will be at least satisfactory), educators should concentrate on selecting out the minority of applicants who are likely to be poorly adjusted to the demands of a professional medical career. The research work to be presented uses a combination of moral orientation and interpersonal dispositions to arrive at a typology of ethical orientations, with certain combinations indicative of poor mental health and dispositions typically associated with behaviours considered unethical within the context of medical practice. The validity of this approach is supported by a growing body of evidence</p>
