<p>Society of Australasian Social Psychologists</p>
<p>Conference 2003</p>

<p>Sydney, 24 - 27 April</p>
<p><strong>Symposium Abstract</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interpersonal traits, orientation and values in the domain of moral behaviour</strong></p>
<p>Presenters: Don Munro and Miles Bore, the University of Newcastle</p>
<p>One approach to the psychology of moral behaviour is to broadly define morality in interpersonal terms: individual differences in how we treat others and are treated by others. The first of the three papers of this symposium presents research in which three highly robust factors have emerged that are thought to influence moral behaviour: empathy, narcissism, and conscience. The second paper presents evidence of the relationship between moral orientation and the domain of values. The findings from three studies indicate a conceptual and empirical link between morality and values than appears stronger than has been found in studies of moral reasoning and values. In the final paper, research involving two recently devised measures rekindles interest in Karen Horney's somewhat forgotten theory of interpersonal relationships finding that Horney's three 'types' are related to the moral dimensions of empathy and narcissism but independent of one's moral orientation.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personality factors in professional ethical behaviour: Studies of empathy and narcissism.</strong></p>
<p>D Munro, MR Bore and DA Powis</p>
<p>An investigation into personality factors possibly underlying ethical behaviour in medical students and doctors suggested the need to investigate two primary dimensions, empathy and narcissism. An experimental self-report questionnaire combining these dimensions was devised and administered in various forms to large samples of medical school applicants (total N &gt; 8000). Factor analyses yielded four factor scales, labelled Narcissism, Aloofness, Empathy and Confidence, which were combined in a 100-item instrument intended for screening purposes. Two validation studies were subsequently undertaken, with New Zealand medical students (n = 237) and Scottish medical school applicants (n = 510), with different batteries of personality, values and attitude scales, plus a measure of moral orientation (see Bore et al., this symposium). Both samples yielded strikingly similar factor structures, showing separate factors for narcissism (related to disagreeableness, rejection of social conventions, anxiety, aggression, social dominance and reward sensitivity), empathy (related positively to emotional intelligence, openness, 'moving towards' others and negatively to aloofness and tough-mindedness), and moral orientation, plus a bipolar general factor Extraversion versus Neuroticism.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Libertarian and Communitarian moral orientations and Schwartz's individual and collective value types.</strong></p>
<p>MR Bore, D Munro, I Kerridge and DA Powis</p>
<p>Schwartz (1992) proposed that his 10 value types could be categorized as serving individual or collective interests. In the domain of moral decision-making, responses to hypothetical moral dilemmas have been found to form a Libertarian-Communitarian dimension of moral orientation. In an earlier study (Bore, Munro, Kerridge, and Powis under review), undergraduate psychology students and applicants to medical school (n = 166) completed the Schwartz (1992) Values Scale (SVS) and the Mojac moral orientation scale. Significant relationships were found between moral orientation and four value types. Factor analysis revealed a possible third bi-polar value dimension of <em>Freedom of the Individual versus Duty to the Group</em> that could be added to Schwartz's two dimensional value structure. In a second study, 119 Australian and 201 New Zealand medical school students completed an experimental 'values in conflict' scale consisting of 30 value pairs. Factor analysis again indicated a three-factor structure with the Freedom of the Individual versus Duty to the Group factor found to be moderately related to moral orientation. The findings suggest that additional values could be added to the SVS and that a third value dimension provides a link between the domains of values and morality.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personality factors in interpersonal behaviour: explorations with Horney's Type theory.</strong></p>
<p>D Munro and MR Bore.</p>
<p>Until recently the theories of Karen Horney (1945, 1950) were neglected except by a tiny minority of clinicians. She proposed 'Types' which refer to ways of handling interpersonal relationships stemming from childhood experience: Compliant (Moving Towards People), Aggressive (Moving Against People) and Detached (Moving Away From People). The appearance of two separate measuring instruments for these, by Coolidge (2001) and Hess (unpublished), provides the opportunity to explore aspects of interpersonal behaviour that could be of relevance to many areas of social psychology. Two analyses are reported, one based on class exercises with psychology students to investigate the relationships within and between the Coolidge and Hess scales, and the other involving the use of the Coolidge instrument with a sample of Scottish medical school applicants (n=510). These analyses reveal satisfactory psychometric characteristics and construct validity, but suggest the factor structure is simpler than in Horney's model.</p>
