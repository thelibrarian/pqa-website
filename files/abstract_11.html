                            initial findings.</p>
                        <p>Previous research by the authors (under review) has
                          provided evidence of the construct validity of a measure
                          of moral orientation and a measure of moral traits.
                          Using a variety of marker scales, a three-factor structure
                          consisting of Empathy, Assertiveness (or Aggressiveness)
                          and Conscience (or Superego) was consistently found
                          across several samples. In particular, Psychoticism
                          (EPQ; Eysenck), Self-Control (16PF; Cattell) and moral
                          orientation scores (Mojac; Bore, 2001) were found to
                          load on Conscience while Narcissism (NACE scale; Munro,
                          1998), Power, Strength and Malevolence (Horney Coolidge
                          Type Indicator; Coolidge, 2001), and Agreeableness
                          (negatively; IPIP; Goldberg, 1999) loaded on Assertiveness.
                          To further explore this structure select items from
                          the measures used were examined and re-worded in a
                          form similar to that used in Goldberg's 100
                          item IPIP Big 5 questionnaire. This experimental scale,
                          named the SEA scale (Superego, Empathy and Aggression)
                          was included in a test battery administered to 947
                          applicants to medical schools in Scotland and England.
                          Factor analysis of the 52 SEA items yielded clear Empathy
                          and Superego factors. However, the Aggression items
                          produced three factors: willingness to use Anger against
                          others, desire to Dominate others, and Passivity (negative &#8211; avoidance
                          of conflict). While tentative, the findings support
                          McKenzie's (1988) suggestion of a Superego versus
                          Psychoticism trait and provide some insight into the
                          possible facets of a trait of Aggression.</p>

                        (another) Big Sixth?</p>
                        <p>Previous work with personality
                          variables associated with a moral/ethical orientation
                          factor in medical
                          school applicants and students has identified two primary
                          dimensions of note, namely empathy and narcissism.
                          In previous studies (see Munro &amp; Bore, AJP in press)
                          these have been identified as separate factors, with
                          moral orientation as a third independent factor. On
                          this basis a tentative theory of ethical behaviour
                          has been put forward. The present study involved an
                          attempt to replicate this factor structure in a sample
                          (n=402) of applicants to a medical school in England.
                          In addition to two instruments devised by the authors
                          (Mojac, a measure of moral orientation, and NACE, a
                          measure of personality dimensions including empathy
                          and narcissism), applicants completed a version of
                          Goldberg's 'Big Five' instrument, an expanded version
                          of the Lovibond &amp; Lovibond DASS instrument, and
                          a reasoning test. Biographical details were also available.
                          Analysis revealed separate 'Big Five' factors, two
                          separate factors for moral orientation/conscience and
                          reasoning, and a single bipolar factor involving empathy
                          and narcissism. Implications for a dispositional theory
                      of ethical behaviour are discussed.</p></td>
