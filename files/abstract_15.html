                        <p> <strong>Teaching ethics: can ethics be learned, and if so,
                              what changes?</strong></p>
                        <p>Miles Bore, The University of Newcastle.</p>
                        <p>The tertiary teaching of ethics within professional
                          degrees such as medicine, nursing, law, and psychology
                          has gained considerable momentum in recent years. This
                          paper describes the experience of teaching the ethics
                          of psychological practice to first year psychology
                          students and focuses on the qualitative changes observed
                          in, and exchanges between, the students. Students appeared
                          to readily engage with ethical dilemma scenarios presented
                          as part of the course, and to critically consider descriptions
                          of ethical problems and expectations given by practicing
                          psychologists as visiting lecturers. Many students
                          indicated an apparent conflict of values or principles
                          expressed, at times heatedly, in terms of a tension
                          between the rights and well-being of a client and the
                          expectations and demands of the profession and society.
                          This was particularly evident in discussions concerning
                          confidentiality. It will be argued that these observations,
                          together with empirical findings concerning changes
                          in moral orientation in a sample of medical school
                          students, suggest that teaching ethics might increase
                          the ethical sensitivity and the propensity for ethical
                          professional behaviour of some students, but not all
                          students.</p>

                        <p>This
                              paper looks at the identification and measurement
                            of desirable and undesirable traits that have been
                                considered in the screening of medical students
                            in terms of personal suitability for ethical medical
                                practice. We will review work that has been going
                                on for some years (originally presented at the
                            1998
                                APS Annual Conference in Melbourne) on (i) a
                          measure of moral orientation based on the dimension
                          Communitarianism
                                versus Libertarianism, and (ii) a personality
                          measure of empathy versus narcissism. We will provide
                          evidence
                                of reliability and validity from studies in several
                                countries, together with factor analyses which
                            indicate the existence of three separate factors
                          for constructs
                                related to moral orientation, empathy and narcissism.
                                This work provides support for a new three-factor
                                model of moral behaviour, which is currently
                          being tested against the behaviours of medical students.
                                The question of whether this approach may be
                          transferable
                                to the screening of psychology students (and
                          students of other helping professions) will be raised
                          for
                          discussion.</p>
