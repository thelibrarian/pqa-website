                          Graduate applicants compared to school leavers were
                            significantly older, more likely to be male and come
                            from a non-independent school, had significantly
                            worse GCSE and A-level scores, were more conscientious,
                            rule-conscious, and communitarian in moral orientation,
                            were less anxious, and had less content in their
                        UCAS personal statements.</p>

                          Both academic and non-academic factors predict success

                            the 5-year course is by academic (mostly A-levels)
                            and non-academic criteria (UCAS personal statement,
                            web-based questionnaire and semi-structured interview).
                            Entry to the graduate 4-year programme is by an (essentially)
                            academic examination (GAMSAT) and a structured interview
                            assessing non-academic attributes in the top GAMSAT
                            performers (~15%). Do both academic and non-academic

                          Using univariate analyses, those receiving an offer
                            on 5- and 4-year courses were only significantly
                            different from those not receiving an offer in terms
                            of academic criteria (higher GCSE and MAT scores
                            in those receiving an offer). There were no differences
                        in non-academic criteria. </p>

                          was the average GCSE points and for the 4-year course
                          it was average GCSE points, average A-level points

                            outcome. If confirmed with larger numbers, a different
                            selection process should be devised which gives greater
                        weight to non-academic criteria.</p></td>
