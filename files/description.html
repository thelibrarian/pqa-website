      <p>
        <span class="pqa">PQA</span> is an instrument designed to assess a
        range of personal qualities considered to be important for the study
        and practice of medicine, dentistry and other health professions. It
        comprises questions, grouped into three sections, the first to measure
        cognitive skills, the other two to measure particular
        personality/attitudinal traits relevant to health professional
        practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Test 1</strong> ('MAT'; Mental Agility Test, D Munro &amp; MR
        Bore) is designed to measure fluid intelligence. It is a high level
        reasoning ability skills test containing questions similar to those
        found in many &quot;I.Q.&quot; tests. It is designed to discriminate
        between those of higher than average ability in this dimension. The
        test asks a series of verbal, numerical and spatial problem-solving
        questions. There are 45 questions to answer in 60 minutes. (<a
        href="/files/mat.html">Click here for example questions</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Test 2</strong> ('Mojac'; Interpersonal Values, Social
        Responsibility, MR Bore) describes a number of situations where people
        have to decide what to do according to their opinions or values.
        Unlike Test 1, there are no right or wrong answers to the 49 questions
        in this test. Rather, candidates are asked to choose the answer that
        most closely reflects their value system and what they believe is
        appropriate in each situation. (<a href="/files/mojac.html">Click here
        for example questions</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Test 3</strong> ('NACE'; Interpersonal Traits, D Munro)
        presents 100 statements about people and lists the way individuals
        might think and behave in certain situations. Again, there are no
        right or wrong answers. Instead, candidates are asked to indicate how
        true or false each statement is about themselves. The time allowed to
        answer the questions in Tests 2 and 3 is 60 minutes. (<a
        href="/files/nace.html">Click here for example questions</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Test 4</strong> ('PCI'; Personal Characteristics Inventory, MR
        Bore, D Munro &amp; DA Powis) asks respondents to rate themselves on
        100 statements designed to establish how honest they are about
        themselves and how truthful they are about their thoughts, feelings
        and attitudes The time allowed to answer the questions in Test 4 is 20
        minutes. (<a href="/files/pci.html">Click here for example
        questions</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="pqa">PQA</span> is available as a hard copy test, with
        questions printed in booklets, or in electronic form where candidates
        complete the test under supervised conditions at a computer terminal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Full instructions are given with each test. The test does not start
        until all candidates are clear about what they are expected to do.
        Candidates' answers to the test questions are made either in an OMR
        scannable Response Booklet or directly to server if the test is taken
        using keyboard and screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Candidates do not require any specific preparation or knowledge to
        undertake <span class="pqa">PQA</span>. The questions do not test
        academic knowledge and do not require any special understanding of
        science. Furthermore training and practice in the test items is
        neither necessary nor advantageous.
