                        <p>BACKGROUND Recently there has been much scrutiny of
                          the medical school admissions process by universities,
                          the General Medical Council and the public. Improved
                          objectivity, fairness and effectiveness of selection
                          procedures are desirable. The ultimate outcome sought
                          is the graduation of competent doctors who reflect
                          the values of and are in tune with the communities
                          they serve.</p>
                        <p>METHODS Applicants to the Scottish medical
                          schools sat a battery of psychometric tests to measure
                          cognitive
                          ability, personality traits and moral / ethical reasoning
                          (Personal Qualities Assessment, PQA). Analysis determined
                          the potential impact of the latter variables, and those
                          of educational background and socioeconomic class (assessed
                          by residential 'deprivation category'),
                          upon success in gaining a place to studymedicine.</p>
                        <p>RESULTS
                            Cognitive ability did not vary significantly as a
                          function of gender or educational background,
                            although there was a trend for it to be lower in
                          individuals from more deprived backgrounds. Women as
                          a group were
                            more empathic, with a greater communitarian orientation,
                            than men. There was no significant difference between
                            individuals attending independent and state-funded
                            schools in respect of any of the qualities measured
                            by the PQA. Applicants from deprived backgrounds
                          and those attending state-funded schools would not
                          be disadvantaged
                            by an admissions process based on the PQA.</p>
                        <p>CONCLUSION
                            The incorporation of an assessment tool such as the
                            PQA may have positive implications for
                            widening access and the objective selection of suitable
                            medical students, resulting in the training of doctors
                            who are more representative of the community at large.
                            A long term follow-up of the professional careers
                          of those medical students who completed the PQA will
                          be
                            undertaken.</p></td>
