                        <p><strong>Selecting occupational therapy students: abilities
                          and personal qualities for practice.</strong></p>
                        <p>Presentation
                            to ANZAME, Adelaide, 24-27 June</p>
                        <p><em>Context:</em> Students entering professional preparation
                          programs in occupational therapy [OT] are typically
                          selected on the basis of academic performance alone.
                          As an adjunct to student selection on academic performance,
                          semi-structured interviews have been adopted by several
                          of the University of Newcastle&#8217;s health professional
                          programs, including OT and medicine. In the case of
                          the University&#8217;s medical program, testing for
                          specific abilities and personal qualities has been
                          combined with interviewing and academic indicators,
                          with good outcomes relative to other Australian medical
                          schools. The goal of any educational OT program is
                          to produce the &#8216;best possible&#8217; graduates
                          who possess the knowledge, abilities and personal qualities
                          for excellence in the practice of OT.</p>
                        <p><em>Purpose:</em> To determine what specific abilities and
                          personal qualities are considered by practitioners
                          to be most important in the practice of OT with a view
                          to including these in selection testing procedures. </p>
                        <p><em>Procedures:</em> Stage 1: From a focus group of Newcastle
                          OT academics, a list of desirable and undesirable abilities
                          and traits of OT practitioners was identified.<br>
                          Stage 2: From this list a questionnaire was developed
                          and completed by 175 OT professionals who rated, added
                          to, and commented on the abilities and traits listed
                        in the questionnaire.</p>
                        <p><em>Results:</em> The most highly rated <em>abilities</em> were in communication
                          and problem-solving; while the <em>qualities</em> of respecting
                          others, self-responsibility, and ethical orientation
                          were rated highest. The results suggest that students
                          who have the ability to reason logically, who tend
                          to value individual autonomy, and who can relate easily
                          to people might excel in the OT profession.</p>
                        <p><em>Conclusion:</em> This research highlights abilities and
                          personal qualities that could be added to current selection
                          criteria to assist in identifying high quality candidates
                          for entry into OT education. </p>
                        <p><em>Learning Outcomes:</em> From this poster, participants
                          will be prompted to consider the adequacy of current
                          student selection criteria relative to the professional
                          competencies required of graduates.</p>
