                        <p><strong>Interpersonal traits, orientation
                          and values in the domain of moral behaviour</strong></p>
                        <p>Presenters: Don Munro and Miles Bore, The University
                          of Newcastle</p>
                        <p>One approach to the psychology of moral behaviour
                          is to broadly define morality in interpersonal terms:
                          individual differences in how we treat others and are
                          treated by others. The first of the three papers of
                          this symposium presents research in which three highly
                          robust factors have emerged that are thought to influence
                          moral behaviour: empathy, narcissism, and conscience.
                          The second paper presents evidence of the relationship
                          between moral orientation and the domain of values.
                          The findings from three studies indicate a conceptual
                          and empirical link between morality and values than
                          appears stronger than has been found in studies of
                          moral reasoning and values. In the final paper, research
                          involving two recently devised measures rekindles interest
                          in Karen Horney's somewhat forgotten theory of
                          interpersonal relationships finding that Horney's
                          three 'types' are related to the moral
                          dimensions of empathy and narcissism but independent
                          of one's moral orientation.</p>

                        <p><strong>Personality factors in professional ethical behaviour:
                          studies of empathy and narcissism.</strong></p>

                        <p>An investigation into personality factors possibly
                          underlying ethical behaviour in medical students and
                          doctors suggested the need to investigate two primary
                          dimensions, empathy and narcissism. An experimental
                          self-report questionnaire combining these dimensions
                          was devised and administered in various forms to large
                          samples of medical school applicants (total N &gt; 8000).
                          Factor analyses yielded four factor scales, labelled
                          Narcissism, Aloofness, Empathy and Confidence, which
                          were combined in a 100-item instrument intended for
                          screening purposes. Two validation studies were subsequently
                          undertaken, with New Zealand medical students (n=237)
                          and Scottish medical school applicants (n=510), with
                          different batteries of personality, values and attitude
                          scales, plus a measure of moral orientation (see Bore
                          et al, this symposium). Both samples yielded strikingly
                          similar factor structures, showing separate factors
                          for narcissism (related to disagreeableness, rejection
                          of social conventions, anxiety, aggression, social
                          dominance and reward sensitivity), empathy (related
                          positively to emotional intelligence, openness, 'moving
                          towards' others and negatively to aloofness and
                          tough-mindedness), and moral orientation, plus a bipolar
                          general factor Extraversion versus Neuroticism.</p>

                        <p><strong>Libertarian and Communitarian moral orientations and
                          Schwartz's individual and collective value types.</strong></p>
                        <p>MR Bore, D Munro, I Kerridge and DA Powis</p>
                        <p>Schwartz (1992) proposed that his 10 value types could
                          be categorized as serving individual or collective
                          interests. In the domain of moral decision-making,
                          responses to hypothetical moral dilemmas have been
                          found to form a Libertarian-Communitarian dimension
                          of moral orientation. In an earlier study (Bore, Munro,
                          Kerridge, and Powis under review), undergraduate psychology
                          students and applicants to medical school (n = 166)
                          completed the Schwartz (1992) Values Scale (SVS) and
                          the Mojac moral orientation scale. Significant relationships
                          were found between moral orientation and four value
                          types. Factor analysis revealed a possible third bi-polar
                          value dimension of Freedom of the Individual versus
                          Duty to the Group that could be added to Schwartz's
                          two dimensional value structure. In a second study,
                          119 Australian and 201 New Zealand medical school students
                          completed an experimental 'values in conflict' scale
                          consisting of 30 value pairs. Factor analysis again
                          indicated a three-factor structure with the Freedom
                          of the Individual versus Duty to the Group factor found
                          to be moderately related to moral orientation. The
                          findings suggest that additional values could be added
                          to the SVS and that a third value dimension provides
                          a link between the domains of values and morality. </p>

                        <p><strong>Personality factors in interpersonal behaviour: explorations
                          with Horney's Type theory.</strong></p>
                        <p>D Munro and MR Bore.</p>
                        <p>Until recently the theories of Karen Horney (1945,
                          1950) were neglected except by a tiny minority of clinicians.
                          She proposed 'Types' which refer to ways
                          of handling interpersonal relationships stemming from
                          childhood experience: Compliant (Moving Towards People),
                          Aggressive (Moving Against People) and Detached (Moving
                          Away From People). The appearance of two separate measuring
                          instruments for these, by Coolidge (2001) and Hess
                          (unpublished), provides the opportunity to explore
                          aspects of interpersonal behaviour that could be of
                          relevance to many areas of social psychology. Two analyses
                          are reported, one based on class exercises with psychology
                          students to investigate the relationships within and
                          between the Coolidge and Hess scales, and the other
                          involving the use of the Coolidge instrument with a
                          sample of Scottish medical school applicants (n=510).
                          These analyses reveal satisfactory psychometric characteristics
                          and construct validity, but suggest the factor structure
                          is simpler than in Horney's model.</p>
