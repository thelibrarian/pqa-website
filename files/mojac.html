      <p>The Exam Dilemma. &copy; Miles Bore, PQA, 2003</p>
      <p>Situation</p>
      <p>
        Peter and Jenny have known each other from childhood. Although from
        different families, they have always attended the same school and have
        lived next door to each other all their lives. They are as close as
        brother and sister. They are now in their final year of school.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a Mathematics exam, Peter happens to glance at Jenny who is sitting
        some three desks away and sees her take a sheet of paper from her coat
        pocket. Peter continues to stare and cannot believe what he is seeing -
        Jenny is cheating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some time after the exam, a teacher approaches Peter and says,
        &quot;Jenny is in a lot of trouble. She has been accused of cheating,
        but I am certain she would not do that. You were sitting near her in the
        exam. Would you come with me to see the School Principal now and say
        that you saw no evidence of her cheating?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>

        statements?
