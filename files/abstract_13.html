                            of Newcastle</p>                        <p>                          Ethical behaviour within the practice of medicine can
                            also be considered a concern during medical education
                            and, perhaps, at the point of applicant selection
                            to medical schools. Past theory and research in moral
                            psychology has not, however, provided models or measures
                            of ethical behaviour that have been clearly demonstrated
                            to accurately and reliably measure individual differences
                            in ethical behaviour. As part of a broader research
                            program initiated in 1997, this paper describes the
                            development of the Dissonance Model and measure of
                            individual differences in moral decision making.
                            Research to date has been conducted with over 8,000
                            respondents including applicants to medical schools,
                            medical students from Australia, Fiji, Israel and
                            New Zealand, psychology students and practising clinicians.
                            The studies have indicated that some respondents
                            consistently give greater importance to cognitions
                            concerning the perceived rights, welfare and relationships
                            of individuals while other respondents consistently
                            give greater importance to the perceived welfare
                            and stability of the group. The former response pattern
                            is considered to reflect a Libertarian orientation
                            to moral decision making and the latter a Communitarian
                            orientation. A third response pattern of giving near
                            equal importance to both Libertarian and Communitarian
                            cognitions is also evident in the studies and is
                            considered to reflect a Dual orientation. The results
                            have continuously shown the measure to be highly
                            reliable and have also provided evidence of model
                            and measure validity including support for the hypothesised
                            existence of a Libertarian to Communitarian psychological
                            construct. The ethical considerations of the utility
                            of the measure as part of medical school applicant
                        selection procedures are also outlined.</p></td>
