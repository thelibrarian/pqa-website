                          differences, Adelaide, July 2005</p>                        
                        <p>Our previous research has identified a Libertarian-Communitarian
                          (Lib-Com) dimension of moral orientation. When presented
                          with a series of moral dilemmas (the Mojac Scale) some
                          respondents strongly agree with items that support
                          individual rights and well-being while others strongly
                          agree with opposing items that support the laws and
                          norms of society. However, a proportion of respondents
                          strongly agree with both items types. This we labeled
                          as a Dual moral orientation. According to Festinger
                          (1957), a context in which two relevant and equally
                          valued cognitions are in conflict 
                          produces cognitive dissonance. Nine hundred participants
                          completed a computer administered version of the Mojac
                          scale which also included dissonance and certainty
                          items. As hypothesised, curvilinear relationships were
                          found. Dual oriented respondents experienced greater
                          dissonance and greater uncertainty when making moral
                          decisions than Libertarian or Communitarian oriented
                          respondents. Festinger's theory explains why some people
                          experience greater psychological discomfort than others
                          when faced with a moral dilemma.</p>

                            times for personality-type scales, although rarely
                            utilised, are usually regarded as measures of
                          uncertainty. Longer response times are reported for
                          item content that is inconsistent with respondents'
                            self-schemas, or which is emotionally arousing (e.g.,
                            Holden, Kroner,
                          Fekken &amp; Popham, 1992: Temple &amp; Geisnger, 1990).
                          In this study, a scale utilising moral dilemmas (see
                          Bore et al, Part 1) was administered by computer to
                          900 medical school applicants, and the time taken to
                          respond to each item was captured. Various item types
                          were used in the scale, including those intended to
                          measure certainty and cognitive dissonance. Item responses
                          were compared to their latencies, using various transformations
                          of the time data, to examine whether latencies could
                          provide greater precision of uncertainty indicators.
                          The results generally confirm the earlier research
                          reports, but inconsistencies in the relationships for
                          different item types limit the reliability of measures
                      based on response times.</p></td>
