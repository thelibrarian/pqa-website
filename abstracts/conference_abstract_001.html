<p>The nursing profession faces a continuing workforce shortage. One strategy to combat this shortage has been to increase the number of nursing students graduating from pre-registration education. Undermining this strategy are the issues of progression and retention. This national and global shortage of nurses warrants an investigation of selection strategies for undergraduate nursing programmes. Prior academic performance, either at school or through previous vocational courses, is the current criterion for admission to most Australian undergraduate nursing programmes. However, an individual’s prior academic achievement may not be the best predictor of academic performance. For over a decade schools of medicine have examined students’ personal qualities as an indicator of performance through undergraduate programmes. These explorations resulted in the development of the Personal Qualities Assessment (www.pqa.net.au) tool. The PQA examines students' ethics and morality; interpersonal traits; personal values/status; and self-regulation and mental resilience. The PQA is being used increasingly across the world to ascertain the possibilities of determining if students’ personal qualities are an indicator for performance. This paper discusses the validity of using the PQA to measure nursing qualities in nursing students. The idea of identifying the qualities of a registered nurse is an onerous process. Yet within Australia the qualities of a registered nurse are clearly outlined in the nursing professional codes and standards. Should we consider recruiting students who possess these qualities? This paper discusses the outcome of mapping the PQA to nursing’s professional codes and standards. This mapping demonstrates the close association between the PQA and the professional codes and standards. If we are to consider changing selection criteria for undergraduate nursing programmes it is important that we begin investigating nursing students’ personal qualities to determine whether these criteria can be used as predictors of performance within our programmes.</p>
