<p><em>Context</em>: In selecting students for health professional programs it is increasingly acknowledged that in addition to prior academic achievement there is a need to seek evidence for the abilities and personal qualities of applicants that may be required by the specific health profession. <em>Objectives</em>: To determine the specific abilities and personal qualities required of excellence in the practice in the relevant professional domains of Medical Radiation Science (MRS). <em>Methods:</em> A focus group, consisting of academic MRS staff, modified and added to a questionnaire originally developed from a focus group of Occupational Therapy academic staff. The questionnaire was sent to senior MRS practitioners throughout Australia and 213 were returned for analysis. Respondents were asked to rate 40 specific abilities and qualities (referred to as '<em>elements</em>') on a 5 point scale ranging from <em>Essential to Irrelevant</em> and to provide comments and additional elements. <em>Main Outcomes</em>: No major differences were found between the ratings provided by practitioners from the MRS professional domains of Diagnostic Radiography, Radiation Therapy and Nuclear Medicine. Factor analysis indicated the existence of three orthogonal factors underlying the questionnaire data: <em>Treat others professionally and ethically, Engage with and be open to others</em>, and <em>Problem solving ability</em>. Qualitative analysis of respondents' comments provided similar themes: the need for <em>Professional Competence</em> (knowledge and abilities), <em>Ethical Behaviour</em> (orientation toward patients and colleagues/other health professionals), the need for a <em>Technology and a People Orientation</em>, and that MRS should be the <em>First Choice</em> of MRS students and not a second choice to other professional degrees such as medicine. <em>Conclusions</em>: Senior Medical Radiation Scientists identified professionalism, ethical behaviour, engagement and openness to others, intrinsic motivation and an orientation to people and technology as non-academic qualities required for excellence in the practice of the relevant MRS profession.</p>
