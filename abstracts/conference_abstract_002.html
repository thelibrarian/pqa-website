<p><strong>Munro, D., Bore, M. R., &amp; Powis, D. A. (2010, Jul). Using the Sherman and Funder (2009) Method to validate a medical school selection model. Paper presented at the 27th International Congress of Applied Psychology, Melbourne, VIC.</strong></p>
<p>We aimed to validate a battery of personality and ability tests used for medical school selection against a variety of academic, clinical and behavioural measures collected over two years at a collaborating medical school. The pattern of relationships (significant correlations) provided suggestive evidence of validity, but the large number of relationships made clear interpretation difficult using traditional statistical approaches. The paper presents a reinterpretation of the results using the technique proposed by Sherman &amp; Funder (2009), in which the probabilities of obtaining the observed number of statistically significant correlations (or the average size of these correlations) are computed using randomization tests. Using the routines in the statistical package R, we found patterns of results indicating a partial confirmation of the validity of some predictors.</p>
