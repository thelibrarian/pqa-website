<p><strong>Bore, M. R., Munro, D., Kerridge, I., &amp; Powis, D. A. (2003, Apr). Libertarian and communitarian moral orientations and Schwartz's individual and collective value types. Paper presented at the Annual Conference of the Society of Australasian Social Psychologists, Sydney, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>Schwartz (1992) proposed that his 10 value types could be categorized as serving individual or collective interests. In the domain of moral decision-making, responses to hypothetical moral dilemmas have been found to form a Libertarian-Communitarian dimension of moral orientation. In an earlier study (Bore, Munro, Kerridge, and Powis under review), undergraduate psychology students and applicants to medical school (n = 166) completed the Schwartz (1992) Values Scale (SVS) and the Mojac moral orientation scale. Significant relationships were found between moral orientation and four value types. Factor analysis revealed a possible third bi-polar value dimension of <em>Freedom of the Individual versus Duty to the Group</em> that could be added to Schwartz's two dimensional value structure. In a second study, 119 Australian and 201 New Zealand medical school students completed an experimental 'values in conflict' scale consisting of 30 value pairs. Factor analysis again indicated a three-factor structure with the Freedom of the Individual versus Duty to the Group factor found to be moderately related to moral orientation. The findings suggest that additional values could be added to the SVS and that a third value dimension provides a link between the domains of values and morality.</p>
