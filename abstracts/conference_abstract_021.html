<p><strong>Munro, D., &amp; Bore, M. R. (2003, May). Assessing and selecting future practitioners: can we and should we? Paper presented at the 1st NSW State APS Conference, Newcastle, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>This paper looks at the identification and measurement of desirableÂ and undesirable traits that have been considered in the screening of medical students in terms of personal suitability for ethical medical practice. We will review work that has been going on for some years (originally presented at the 1998 APS Annual Conference in Melbourne) on (i) a measure of moral orientation based on the dimension Communitarianism versus Libertarianism, and (ii) a personality measure of empathy versus narcissism. We will provide evidence of reliability and validity from studies in several countries, together with factor analyses which indicate the existence of three separate factors for constructs related to moral orientation, empathy and narcissism. This work provides support for a new three-factor model of moral behaviour, which is currently being tested against the behaviours of medical students. The question of whether this approach may be transferable to the screening of psychology students (and students of other helping professions) will be raised for discussion.</p>
