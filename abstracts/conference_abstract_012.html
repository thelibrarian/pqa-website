<p><strong>Bore, M. R., Munro, D., &amp; Powis, D. A. (2004, Dec). Individual differences when responding to moral dilemmas, Part 1: Orientation, cognitive dissonance and certainty. Paper presented at the 3rd Australian Conference on Personality and Individual Differences, Ballart, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>Our previous research has identified a Libertarian-Communitarian (Lib-Com) dimension of moral orientation. When presented with a series of moral dilemmas (the Mojac Scale) some respondents strongly agree with items that support individual rights and well-being while others strongly agree with opposing items that support the laws and norms of society. However, a proportion of respondents strongly agree with both item types. This we labelled as a Dual moral orientation. According to Festinger (1957), a context in which two relevant and equally valued cognitions are in conflict produces cognitive dissonance. Nine hundred participants completed a computer administered version of the Mojac scale which also included dissonance and certainty items. As hypothesised, curvilinear relationships were found. Dual oriented respondents experienced greater dissonance and greater uncertainty when making moral decisions than Libertarian or Communitarian oriented respondents. Festinger's theory explains why some people experience greater psychological discomfort than others when faced with a moral dilemma.</p>
