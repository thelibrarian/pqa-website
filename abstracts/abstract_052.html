<p>Personality determinants of interpersonal professional behaviours in medical students.</p>
<p>We have been exploring aspects of personality that may be used to predict the interpersonal skills of medical students and doctors, including those relating to the treatment of patients/clients and those concerned with relationships between medical professionals (e.g., Munro, Bore &amp; Powis, <em>Australian Journal of Psychology</em>, 2005). We describe an extension of the work with ten further facets of personality that have also emerged as relevant, centreing on mental health and self control factors. The results suggest a revised model using three composite dimensions. This model will be discussed in relation to existing theories linking personality and interpersonal behaviours.</p>
