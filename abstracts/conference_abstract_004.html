<p>Personality assessment is used widely in selection procedures in the business sector, the armed services and police services. However, medical and allied health sector educators and employers are only recently considering the use of non-cognitive variables in selection. For some 10 years Bore, Munro and Powis have been developing a three-domain model and self-report measure of interpersonal personality specifically targeted at the interaction between practitioners and their patients/clientsÂ  (e.g., Bore, Munro &amp; Powis, 2009). The three domains are Involvement (empathy, confidence with others) vs Detachment (aloof, narcissistic), Resilience (emotional stability, capable under pressure) vs Reactivity (anxious, moody, volatile) and Control (high self-control, orderly, conscientious vs low self-control, disorderly, disregard for rules). We compared the predictive validity of this Involved, Resilient and Controlled (IRC) model against two other trait-based personality models: the Big 5, measured using the 30 facet IPIP inventory, and the 11 DSM-based traits of the Hogan Development Survey (HDS). The criterion variables were self-report measures of problematic personality styles (Psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and trait Aggression), two measures of psychological distress (the Kessler 10 and Global Severity Index scores from the Brief Symptom Inventory) and two measures of psychological wellness (Subjective Well-Being and Hope). The battery was completed by 236 first year psychology students. Factor analysis results supported the theoretical structure of each of the three models. Using regression analysis the IRC and Big 5 were found to account for a significant proportion of variance in each of the criterion variables with R-Squared (adjusted) values ranging from 38% to 65%. The HDS R-Sq (adjusted) values ranged from 24% to 38%. Both the IRC and the IPIP Big 5 strongly predicted Psychopathy. The implications of the findings in using the models and measures for selection will be discussed. Of specific note is that the results suggest that both the IRC and the IPIP measures could help to detect potentially psychopathic medical practitioners at an early career stage.</p>
