<p>Assessing moral development potential to select students for medical school.</p>
<p>In recent years there has emerged a general consensus that ethics should be included in the education of doctors. Past research suggests that moral reasoning skills may be developed by formal education and by professional experience. This would suggest that the most justifiable basis for selection would be to exclude only those who lack the capacity for moral development. This paper describes the ethical and educational principles underlying the development of a valid measure of "ethics" for selecting potential doctors.</p>
