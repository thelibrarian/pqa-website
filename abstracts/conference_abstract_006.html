<p><strong>Munro, D., Powis, D. A., &amp; Bore, M. R. (2009, Nov). Referees' reports can be very reliable, but also completely invalid. Paper presented at the 8th Australasian Conference on Personality and Individual Differences, Sydney, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>Refereesâ€™ reports on an applicant are a frequently employed component of selection procedures, and the use of rating scales within these is also common. However, despite a constant stream of reports on individual scales (mainly clinical) in recent years, there appears to be very little on the reliability or validity of such rating scales for selection in general, and in particular the use of several judges. The present study was undertaken to investigate the reliability and potential validity of a structured report form devised to aid the selection of candidates for postgraduate medical training. 585 candidates each had three or four assessors return ratings of their communication skills, interpersonal skills and professional competence using a 54-item appraisal form. Although the inventory per se showed a high degree of internal consistency and generalisability, agreement between assessors was nearly zero, as if different people had been assessed rather than single candidates. The methodological and practical implications are discussed.</p>
