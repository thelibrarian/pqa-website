<p><strong>Munro, D., Bore, M. R., &amp; Powis, D. A. (2004, Dec). Individual differences when responding to moral dilemmas, Part 2: the relationship between item response latencies and standard psychometric measures. Paper presented at the 3rd Australian Conference on Personality and Individual Differences, Ballart, VIC.</strong></p>
<p>Response times for personality-type scales, although rarely utilised, are usually regarded as measures of uncertainty. In this study, a scale utilising moral dilemmas (see Bore et al, Part 1) was administered by computer to 900 medical school applicants, and the time taken to respond to each item was captured. Various item types were used in the scale, including those intended to measure certainty and cognitive dissonance; also, respondents can be categorised according to whether they give clear support for one of the moral orientations or are conflicted ('Dualist'). The various item responses were compared to their latencies, using various transformations of the time data. A variety of relationships are reported, that partially support the reliability and validity of the scale and its underlying rationale.</p>
