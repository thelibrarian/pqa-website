<p>Prior academic performance, either at school or through previous vocational courses, is the current criterion for admission to most Australian Bachelor of Nursing programs. However, this approach may not be the best predictor of success in terms of clinical and academic performance. It is difficult to determine if a successful student makes a successful registered nurse (RN). Yet we acknowledge that the student must be competent in relation to the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council competency standards in order to register. These standards include possession of ethical values, beliefs and critical thinking skills and are well explored within undergraduate programs. However, should we take one step further and recruit students into the program who already possess these qualities, as well as assess if our programs can further develop these qualities in students? Within health science programs, such as medicine and social work, personal qualities such as personality, values, and critical thinking skills are increasingly being used as both selection criteria and potential predictors of professional performance. To date, nursing research has concentrated primarily on the correlation between prior academic performance and demographic characteristics, such as, age, gender and socioeconomic status. If we are to consider the use of selection criteria in undergraduate nursing programs it is essential that we begin by investigating nursing students’ personal qualities and determine whether these criteria can be used as predictors of academic and/or clinical performance. This presentation will provide preliminary results from a longitudinal doctoral study exploring the relationship between nursing students’ personal qualities and their academic success, clinical performance and attrition.</p>
