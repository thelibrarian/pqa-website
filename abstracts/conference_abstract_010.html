<p><strong>Munro, D., &amp; Bore, M. R. (2006, Dec). Models of personality: Are we factor-bound? Paper presented at the 5th Australian Conference on Personality and Individual Differences, Newcastle, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>Almost all the models of personality in current use that have been formulated on the basis of multiple scales (or items) are based on factor analyses. This is despite the facts that (i) different factoring methods can produce markedly different structures, (ii) factor analysis invariably proceeds by extracting dimensions of progressively smaller size from the same correlation or covariance matrices, ignoring the possibility that different substructures could exist at different locii in hyperspace, and (iii) our purposes in analysing the data vary widely, from trying to gain a simple understanding of a particular sample, to choosing items for a new test or tests for a battery, and to formulating universal personality theories. Alternative analytic procedures are available, including cluster analysis for variables. The presentation will illustrate these different approaches using a number of available data sets.</p>
