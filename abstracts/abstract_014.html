<p>Values in action scale and the Big 5: An empirical indication of structure</p>
<p>Abstract: Within this study we used self-report measures completed by 123 undergraduate students from an Australian university to investigate the validity of Peterson and Seligman's [C Peterson &amp; MEP Seligman, Character Strengths and Virtues, New York: Oxford, 2004] classification system of 24 character strengths and six virtues. We also looked at how the 24 character strengths relate to the Five Factor Model of personality and to a measure of social desirability. Using a second order factor analysis of the 24 character strengths, we found that these 24 character strengths did not produce a factor structure consistent with the six higher order virtues as proposed by Peterson and Seligman (2004). Instead, the 24 character strengths were well represented by both a one and four factor solution. Patterns of significant relationships between each of the 24 character strengths, the one and four factor solutions and the Five Factor Model of personality were found. The results have implications for Peterson &amp; Seligman's 2004 classification.</p>
