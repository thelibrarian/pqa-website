<p>The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP: Goldberg, 1999, 2006) continues to be a highly valuable resource for personality trait researchers. The aim of the research reported here was twofold: First, to examine the psychometric properties and factor structure of the 100 item version of the IPIP measure of the Big Five from data collected in Australia, New Zealand and Scotland (n = 1341); and, second, to see if 10 "aspects' (mid-level traits) positioned hierarchically between the Big Five traits and their respective facets as found by DeYoung, Quilty and Peterson (2007) could be extracted from this data. As expected, high reliabilities and a clear five factor structure were found. Examination of the loading plots of the 20 items that constitute each Big Five trait suggested that two oblique factors could be extracted for each trait. Comparison of the items of these oblique factors with those compiled by DeYoung, Quilty and Peterson indicated a high degree of conceptual similarity. Furthermore, differential correlations were observed between the oblique mid-level factors and several other concurrently administered measures providing evidence of the construct validity and utility of these ten mid-level traits. The findings contribute to the support for a four-tiered trait model of personality: item (specific behavior), facet, mid-level (or aspect) and super-trait. Refinement of the conceptualization of each of these 'Mid-Level Ten' of the Big Five is suggested and the potential contribution to our understanding of the structure of personality considered.</p>
