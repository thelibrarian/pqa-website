<p>A dissonance model of moral decision making: Libertarian and Communitarian cognitions in conflict.</p>
<p>A model of moral decision making is developed drawing from empirical research conducted by the authors. The model considers that a moral dilemma is the dissonance generating intrapersonal experience of the Libertarian to Communitarian dichotomy. Libertarian oriented individuals consistently give greater importance to the well being of individuals while Communitarian oriented individuals consistently give greater importance to the expectations of the community. The majority of people are Dual oriented giving approximately equal importance to Libertarian and Communitarian cognitions. Individual differences in moral decision making is accounted for by cognitive orientation. Dissonance is considered the cognitive mechanism of moral behaviour.</p>
