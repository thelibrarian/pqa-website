<p><strong>Munro, D. (2002, Jul). The Involved-Detached dimension of moral behaviour: Development and validity of the NACE scale. Paper presented at the Inaugural International Test Users' Conference, Sydney, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>The research program, introduced in Part 1, adopted two different approaches to the exploration of ethical behaviour and the selection of medical school students. One approach, the subject of this paper, was to consider the personality traits that might underlie behaviours in medical students that might be appropriate or inappropriate to the practice of medicine. Initial research resulted in the development of the NACE scale, based on analysis of data from several samples which consistently produced a first order four factor structure of Narcissism, Aloofness, Self-Confidence and Empathy. A second order analysis produced a dimension defined as Involved (Narcissism and Aloofness) versus Detached (Self-Confidence and Empathy). Additional research produced expected relationships between the NACE scale scores and scores from instruments such as the Emotional Intelligence Scale (SchuttÃ© et al., 1998), Cattell's 16 Personality Factors scale (16PF), and a measure of the Big Five personality traits (Goldberg, 2000). These results have been presented earlier (Munro &amp; Bore, 2000, 2001)</p>
<p>In order to provide further evidence of the construct validity of the NACE scale a further study was recently completed by participating medical schools in Scotland and England. In this study, the results of which will be presented in detail in this paper, 600 applicants to medical schools completed a battery of tests consisting of NACE, a modified version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Goldberg's Big Five scale, the Horney Coolidge Type Indicator (2001), the Torrubia et al. (2001) Sensitivity to Punishment – Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire, and the Mojac scale (Bore, 2001). The results were again found to support the validity of the NACE scale. Additionally, and as observed in previous studies, the NACE Involved-Detached dimension was found to be orthogonal to the Mojac scale Libertarian-Communitarian dimension of moral orientations. The Mojac scale and a model of six moral types derived from the orthogonality of the Mojac and NACE scores is the subject of the third paper of this symposium.</p>
