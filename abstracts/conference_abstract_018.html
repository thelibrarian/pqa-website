<p><em>Context:</em> Since 1997 a research team at the University of Newcastle has been developing psychometric measures of personal qualities identified as being important in the context of the practice of medicine: reasoning ability, moral orientation, empathy and narcissism. Before the measures could be used as selection instruments, the influence of demographic (age, gender) and other confounding variables need to be evaluated. <em>Purpose:</em> To examine differences between school-leaver and older applicants to medical schools on three Personal Quality Assessment (PQA) measures. <em>Procedures:</em> School leaver and university graduate applicants to medical schools in Australia and the UK (n = 2111) completed three PQA measures: the Mental Agility Test (MAT; Munro and Bore), a measure of moral orientation (the Mojac Scale; Bore) and the NACE scale (Munro) which quantifies Narcissism, Aloofness, Confidence and Empathy. The tests were scored and score differences based on age, gender and applicant type were analysed for statistical differences. <em>Results:</em> The major significant differences found were that older applicants tended to have lower reasoning ability and a more Communitarian (rather than Libertarian) moral orientation. A weak tendency was observed for females to be more Communitarian, Empathic and less Narcissistic than males who were more Libertarian, Narcissistic and less Empathic. After controlling for Age, no significant differences were found between school-leaver applicants and applicants with a university degree on any of the measures. <em>Conclusion:</em> The gender and age differences observed in reasoning ability, empathy and narcissism reflect the findings generally reported in the literature. The differences in moral orientation could be either a developmental effect or the relative absence of Libertarian oriented applicants in the university graduate samples. Further research is required to determine whether Libertarian oriented people tend to choose a profession other than medicine.</p>
