<p>The meanings of ethical behaviour potential from a personality perspective.</p>
<p>An attempt to construct a selection test for medical students (reported elsewhere in this conference) involved the search for suitable criterion measures against which to validate the instrument. This poster report shows a variety of profiles of moral or ethical behaviour in terms of relationships with personality and other tests and with behavioural measures, and raises the issue of how to provide suitable criteria of prediction in this domain.</p>
