<p>The Big Five personality domains and mental illness: consequential outcome or extended dimensions of the same underlying constructs?</p>
<p>MR Bore, C James &amp; S Zito </p>
<p>Research has generally found significant relationships between personality traits and mental illness. In our past research we found a high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory, in samples of Medicine and Psychology undergraduate students with 30% of participants producing Global Severity Index (GSI) scores equal to or greater than psychiatric inpatient norms. We also found that a greater prevalence of psychiatric symptoms was significantly related to low Extraversion, low Conscientiousness and high Neuroticism personality trait scores. In our current research undergraduate Law students (n = 161) completed a battery of personality and mental heath questionnaires. The results replicated the findings of our previous research in terms of the proportion of participants having GSI scores greater than the psychiatric inpatient norm and the personality trait profile of higher scorers. The results of retesting a sub-sample of First Year Law students will also be reported. The findings raise several questions that will be discussed such as the issue of causation and the possibility that what we are really measuring are positive/adaptive and negative/maladaptive 'symptoms' that form clusters which we label as traits or disorders respectively. This latter view supports the move for a dimensional rather than categorical approach to be adopted in the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for the Fifth edition - a consequential outcome for personality psychology.</p>
