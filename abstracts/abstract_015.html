<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Medical Schools have a need to select their students from an excess of applicants. Selection procedures have evolved piecemeal: academic thresholds have risen, written tests have been incorporated and interview protocols developed.</p>
<p><strong>Aim</strong></p>
<p>To develop and offer for critical review and, ultimately, present for adoption by medical schools, an evidence-based and defensible model for medical student selection.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>We have described here a comprehensive model for selecting medical students which is grounded on the theoretical and empirical selection and assessment literature, and has been shaped by our own research and experience.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The model includes the following selection criteria: informed self-selection, academic achievement, general cognitive ability, and aspects of personality and interpersonal skills. A psychometrically robust procedure by which cognitive and non-cognitive test scores can be used to make selection decisions is described. Using de-identified data (n = 1000) from actual selection procedures we demonstrate how the model and the procedure can be used in practice.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>The model presented is based on a currently best-practice approach and uses measures and methods that maximise the probability of making accurate, fair and defensible selection decisions.</p>
