<p><strong>Powis, D. (2002, Jul). Determining and measuring the personal qualities of competent, ethical medical practitioners: Selecting medical students. Paper presented at the Inaugural International Test Users' Conference, Sydney, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>The sole criterion for entrance to medical school has traditionally been that of prior scholastic achievement. However, awareness of the shortcomings of this single criterion emerged in the medical literature of the last thirty years, in the opinions of those who teach medical students, in the personal experiences of patients, and in the extreme instances that sometimes make headlines in the media. Since 1978, the University of Newcastle has used measures of abilities and personal qualities in conjunction with scholastic ability in their medical school selection procedures. Today, no Australian medical school, and a decreasing number of medical schools worldwide, select only on academic performance. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the abilities and personal traits that research has indicated are relevant and appropriate to underpin competent and ethical medical practice. Traits such as logical reasoning ability, empathy, and sensitivity to the needs of the patient, profession and society, for example, are considered appropriate to the context of medical practice while prejudice, arrogance and impulsiveness would appear inappropriate. However, a number of ethical issues arise in the context of medical school selection such as the need for empirically derived evidence of the reliability and validity of selection instruments and the degree to which the abilities and traits measured might be influenced by the experience of medical education. The validation research program and results of two new psychometric instruments, developed and tested as a project initiated in 1997 by the BMed Admissions Committee at the University of Newcastle, will be presented in the following two papers of the symposium. The project task was to develop psychometric measures that would indicate those applicants to medical school who would be likely to engage in ethically inappropriate behaviour within the practice of medicine. The research program has involved, to date, more than 9,000 applicants to medical school, and students attending medical school, in Australia, Israel, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Fiji, plus a small number of psychology undergraduate students and practising medical clinicians from Australia. The research findings to date have provided evidence of the validity of the measures.</p>
