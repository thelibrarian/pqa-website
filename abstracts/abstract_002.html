<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>An extension of medical school selection from its current emphasis on previous academic performance and cognitive ability is proposed. Three personality variables are suggested as particularly important for the selection of medical students. These are conscientiousness, psychological health or resilience and involvement with others. A number of studies are reviewed that indicate support for the validity of these three variables in relation to medical school performance, the ability to resist stressful experiences and the ability to relate successfully to others in a professional career. We also present the results from the administration of an experimental instrument to 606 medical and other students. Factor analysis identified two broad-spectrum variables, <em>conscientiousness/control</em> and <em>psychological stability</em>. It is proposed that predictive validity research be conducted on these two variables, in conjunction with a previously reported measure of involvement versus detachment.</p>
