<p><strong>Bore, M. R., &amp; Connelly, M. J. (2006, Dec). Studies in self-regulation: individual differences in resilience, control and ego-depletion. Paper presented at the 5th Australian Conference on Personality and Individual Differences, Newcastle, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>Several theorists have espoused a central role of self-control or self-regulation in the domain personality. Tangney et al (2004) conceptualise self-control as a single trait-like dimension where as Block and Block (1980) considered a dynamic view of self-regulation which includes a construct of ego-resilience (vs. ego-brittle). Others, such as Schmeichel and Baumeister (2004), have examined the notion of ego-depletion: self-control as a resource that diminishes over a series self-control tasks. The current study hypothesised that low self-controlled ego-brittle participants would show greater ego-depletion after making a series of moral decisions. While this was not supported, a highly significant interaction demonstrated that after completing a 90 minute battery of tests participants low in self-control displayed ego-depletion while those high in self-control did not. The findings add to the weight of evidence for the validity of the construct of self-control as an individual differences variable.</p>
