<p>Individual differences when responding to moral dilemmas. Part 1: Moral orientation and cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>Our previous research has identified a Libertarian-Communitarian (Lib-Com) dimension of moral orientation. When presented with a series of moral dilemmas (the Mojac Scale) some respondents strongly agree with items that support individual rights and well-being while others strongly agree with opposing items that support the laws and norms of society. However, a proportion of respondents strongly agree with both items types. This we labeled as a Dual moral orientation. According to Festinger (1957), a context in which two relevant and equally valued cognitions are in conflict produces cognitive dissonance. Nine hundred participants completed a computer-administered version of the Mojac scale which also included dissonance and certainty items. As hypothesised, curvilinear relationships were found. Dual oriented respondents experienced greater dissonance and greater uncertainty when making moral decisions than Libertarian or Communitarian oriented respondents. Festinger's theory explains why some people experience greater psychological discomfort than others when faced with a moral dilemma.</p>

<p>Individual differences when responding to moral dilemmas, Part 2: the relationship between item response times as psychometric measures.</p>
<p>Response times for personality-type scales, although rarely utilised, are usually regarded as measures of uncertainty. Longer response times are reported for item content that is inconsistent with respondents' self-schemas, or which is emotionally arousing (e.g., Holden, Kroner, Fekken &amp; Popham, 1992: Temple &amp; Geisnger, 1990). In this study, a scale utilising moral dilemmas (see Bore et al., Part 1) was administered by computer to 900 medical school applicants, and the time taken to respond to each item was captured. Various item types were used in the scale, including those intended to measure certainty and cognitive dissonance. Item responses were compared to their latencies, using various transformations of the time data, to examine whether latencies could provide greater precision of uncertainty indicators. The results generally confirm the earlier research reports, but inconsistencies in the relationships for different item types limit the reliability of measures based on response times.</p>
