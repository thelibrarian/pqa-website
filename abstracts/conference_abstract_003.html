<p>An upsurge of interest in using non‐cognitive selection measures for medical school entry has been hampered by the lack of validity evidence, due partly to the lack of criterion measures other than conventional examinations. In a collaboration with a UK medical school, we assessed several personality dimensions for 140 applicants on entry, and also accessed ability test data, interview ratings, etc. The students were then followed up for two years on a variety of performance measures including examinations and clinical assessments, and three phases of ratings by PBL group tutors. The results show a large number of moderate but significant relationships between personality and performance, and suggest that, with further refinement of the predictor and criterion measures, the use of non‐cognitive measures for selection purposes and student guidance would be defensible.</p>
