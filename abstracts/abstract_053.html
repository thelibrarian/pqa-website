<p>Cultural and discipline differences within a two-factor model of moral types.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1998 we developed measures of two constructs considered to be influential in the domain of moral behaviour. The Mojac scale was developed to measure a Libertarian to Communitarian dimension of moral orientation (valuing the needs, rights and wellbeing of individuals versus the needs, rights and wellbeing of society; Bore, 2001; Bore et al. 2005). The NACE scale was developed to measure Involvement with others versus Detachment (Empathy and Confidence versus Narcissism and Aloofness; Munro et al. 2005). We have administered these tests to samples of applicants to medical schools, students from disciplines such as medicine, psychology, nursing, oral health, pharmacy and other care-based professions from several countries, including Australia, Taiwan, Japan, Israel, Sweden, UK, and Canada, some 27,000 people in total. This poster will present the cultural disciplinary differences we have found on our two-factor model of moral types.</p>
