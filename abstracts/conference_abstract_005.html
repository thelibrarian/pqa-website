<p><strong>Introduction/background:</strong> The nursing profession is faced with a continuing workforce shortage. One strategy to combat this shortage has been to increase the number of nursing students graduating from preregistration education. Undermining this strategy are the recurrent issues of progression and retention of students, which have additional implications for the effective use of program resources and academic workload as well as personal and financial costs for students. Although undergraduate nursing education attrition and completion rates may not be markedly different to other disciplines, the fact there is a national and global shortage of nurses warrants an investigation of selection strategies for undergraduate nursing programs. Prior academic performance, either at school or through previous vocational courses, is the current criterion for admission to most Australian undergraduate preregistration nursing programs. However, this approach may not be the best predictor of success measured by clinical and academic performance. Also it is difficult to determine if a successful student makes a successful registered nurse (RN). It is acknowledged that the student must be competent in relation to the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council competency standards in order to register. These standards include possession of ethical values, beliefs and critical thinking skills and all are well explored within undergraduate programs. However should we take two more steps and 1) recruit students into the program who already possess these qualities, and 2) assess whether our programs can further develop these qualities in students. To date, nursing research, predominantly conducted within the United States and United Kingdom, has concentrated primarily on the correlation between prior academic performance and demographic characteristics, such as, age, gender and socioeconomic status. If we are to consider the use of changed selection criteria for undergraduate nursing programs it is perhaps important that we begin by investigating nursing students’ personal qualities and determine whether these criteria can be used as predictors of academic and/or clinical performance within our programs. <strong>Purpose/objectives:</strong> This presentation will describe a longitudinal descriptive correlational doctoral study that explores the relationship between nursing students’ personal qualities and their academic success, clinical performance and attrition. <strong>Issues/questions for exploration or ideas for discussion:</strong> Faced with a need to produce more nursing graduates it is essential that nursing programs develop graduates whose qualities are reflective of the profession. This presentation will ask controversial questions such as: If we were able to predict nursing students’ performance based on their personal qualities should we use these as criteria to select the “best students” for the program.</p>
