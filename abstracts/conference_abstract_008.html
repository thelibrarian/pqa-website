<p>Attrition, completion rates and academic and/or clinical failure are recurrent issues in undergraduate nursing education. These issues have implications for the effective use of program resources and academic workload as well as personal and financial costs for students. In the context of the difficulty of retaining registered nurses and the continuing workforce shortage it may be time to review the selection criteria and admission processes for undergraduate nursing programs to ensure that the future of nursing is protected. Focusing on selection issues and increasing support of undergraduate nursing students are ways that we can invest in our future profession. Currently admission to undergraduate nursing programs is based on prior academic performance, either at school or in previous vocational courses. Yet such achievement may not be the best predictor of success in terms of clinical performance and professional satisfaction. It has been reported that support seeking behaviour may be one factor which better predicts nursing students’ performance. In health science programs, such as medicine and social work, personal qualities, including personality, values, and critical thinking skills have been investigated as possible predictors for successful performance and are increasingly being used as selection criteria. Selection based on personal qualities rather than prior academic achievement, aims to recruit the most appropriate students for the discipline. This presentation will describe a longitudinal doctoral study that explores the relationship between nursing students’ personal qualities and their academic success, clinical performance and attrition. This paper begins the debate of ”selection or support” and asks controversial questions such as: If we were able to predict nursing students’ performance based on their personal qualities should we use these as criteria to select the “best students” for the program. Or should greater emphasis be placed on providing adequate resources to support nursing students with diverse personal qualities to succeed.</p>
