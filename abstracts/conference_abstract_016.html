<p>Previous research by the authors (under review) has provided evidence of the construct validity of a measure of moral orientation and a measure of moral traits. Using a variety of marker scales, a three-factor structure consisting of Empathy, Assertiveness (or Aggressiveness) and Conscience (or Superego) was consistently found across several samples. In particular, Psychoticism (EPQ; Eysenck), Self-Control (16PF; Cattell) and moral orientation scores (Mojac; Bore, 2001) were found to load on Conscience while Narcissism (NACE scale; Munro, 1998), Power, Strength and Malevolence (Horney Coolidge Type Indicator; Coolidge, 2001), and Agreeableness (negatively; IPIP; Goldberg, 1999) loaded on Assertiveness. To further explore this structure select items from the measures used were examined and re-worded in a form similar to that used in Goldberg's 100 item IPIP Big 5 questionnaire. This experimental scale, named the SEA scale (Superego, Empathy and Aggression) was included in a test battery administered to 947 applicants to medical schools in Scotland and England. Factor analysis of the 52 SEA items yielded clear Empathy and Superego factors. However, the Aggression items produced three factors: willingness to use Anger against others, desire to Dominate others, and Passivity (negative â€“ avoidance of conflict). While tentative, the findings support McKenzie's (1988) suggestion of a Superego versus Psychoticism trait and provide some insight into the possible facets of a trait of Aggression.</p>
