<p><strong>Bore, M. R. (2003, May). Teaching ethics: Can ethics be learned, and if so, what changes? Paper presented at the 1st NSW State APS Conference, Newcastle, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>The tertiary teaching of ethics within professional degrees such as medicine, nursing, law, and psychology has gained considerable momentum in recent years. This paper describes the experience of teaching the ethics of psychological practice to first year psychology students and focuses on the qualitative changes observed in, and exchanges between, the students. Students appeared to readily engage with ethical dilemma scenarios presented as part of the course, and to critically consider descriptions of ethical problems and expectations given by practicing psychologists as visiting lecturers. Many students indicated an apparent conflict of values or principles expressed, at times heatedly, in terms of a tension between the rights and well-being of a client and the expectations and demands of the profession and society. This was particularly evident in discussions concerning confidentiality. It will be argued that these observations, together with empirical findings concerning changes in moral orientation in a sample of medical school students, suggest that teaching ethics might increase the ethical sensitivity and the propensity for ethical professional behaviour of some students, but not all students.</p>
