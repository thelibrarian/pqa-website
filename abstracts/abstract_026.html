<p>Development of a measure and model of moral behaviour: reliability and validity of the MOJAC scale.</p>
<p>Past theory, debate and research concerning moral orientations utilised definitions of Care and Justice orientations as suggested by Gilligan. For this research the operational definitions were reformulated as: a Libertarian orientation, being the level of importance given to the needs, rights and well being of the individual; and a Communitarian orientation, being the level of importance given to the expectations of the group. An objective measure, the MOJAC scale, was developed and administered to approximately 6000 respondents over several studies and found to be reliable and stable. Validity results are also presented.</p>
