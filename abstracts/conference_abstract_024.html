<p><strong>Munro, D., &amp; Bore, M. R. (2003, Apr). Personality factors in interpersonal behaviour: Explorations with Horney's type theory. Paper presented at the Annual Conference of the Society of Australasian Social Psychologists, Sydney, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>Until recently the theories of Karen Horney (1945, 1950) were neglected except by a tiny minority of clinicians. She proposed 'Types' which refer to ways of handling interpersonal relationships stemming from childhood experience: Compliant (Moving Towards People), Aggressive (Moving Against People) and Detached (Moving Away From People). The appearance of two separate measuring instruments for these, by Coolidge (2001) and Hess (unpublished), provides the opportunity to explore aspects of interpersonal behaviour that could be of relevance to many areas of social psychology. Two analyses are reported, one based on class exercises with psychology students to investigate the relationships within and between the Coolidge and Hess scales, and the other involving the use of the Coolidge instrument with a sample of Scottish medical school applicants (n=510). These analyses reveal satisfactory psychometric characteristics and construct validity, but suggest the factor structure is simpler than in Horney's model.</p>
