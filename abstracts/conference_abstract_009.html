<p><strong>Bore, M. R., &amp; Munro, D. (2006, Dec). Selecting out on the basis of potential unethical behaviour. Paper presented at the 5th Australian Conference on Personality and Individual Differences, Newcastle, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>Many suggestions have been made in the medical education literature over the years about the desiderata for medical students and practitioners, ranging from such traits/skills as empathy and communication skills to resistance to fatigue and stress. There are many problems with attempting to select students on such criteria, not least being the difficulty of formulating a practicable battery of valid tests. It can also be argued that many of the required qualities should be deliberately taught, or can be passively acquired, during medical education. The approach advocated in this paper is that, rather than focusing on selecting students on the basis of 'good' characteristics (on which most applicants will be at least satisfactory), educators should concentrate on selecting out the minority of applicants who are likely to be poorly adjusted to the demands of a professional medical career. The research work to be presented uses a combination of moral orientation and interpersonal dispositions to arrive at a typology of ethical orientations, with certain combinations indicative of poor mental health and dispositions typically associated with behaviours considered unethical within the context of medical practice. The validity of this approach is supported by a growing body of evidence.</p>
