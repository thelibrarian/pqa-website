<p>Michael Lyons, Lynette Mackenzie, Miles Bore and David Powis</p>
<p><strong>Background/Aim:</strong> Demand for places in occupational therapy programs at Australian universities may place undue emphasis on academic attainment when selecting students ... but how else might students be selected? This study investigated those attributes judged by occupational therapy practitioners to be most important.</p>
<p><strong>Methods: </strong>From a focus group of occupational therapy academics, a list of occupational therapy practice attributes was generated and used to develop a questionnaire completed by 175 Australian occupational therapy practitioners.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> The most highly rated abilities were communication and problem-solving skills; the most highly rated qualities were respecting others, self-responsibility and ethical orientation.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> This research has identified abilities and personal qualities that could be added to current selection criteria to assist in identifying suitable candidates for entry into occupational therapy education.</p>
