<p><strong>Munro, D., &amp; Bore, M. R. (2003, Dec). Empathy versus narcissism: two separate factors or (another) Big Sixth? Paper presented at the 2nd Australian Conference on Personality and Individual Differences, Brisbane, QLD.</strong></p>
<p>Previous work with personality variables associated with a moral/ethical orientation factor in medical school applicants and students has identified two primary dimensions of note, namely empathy and narcissism. In previous studies (see Munro &amp; Bore, AJP in press) these have been identified as separate factors, with moral orientation as a third independent factor. On this basis a tentative theory of ethical behaviour has been put forward. The present study involved an attempt to replicate this factor structure in a sample (n=402) of applicants to a medical school in England. In addition to two instruments devised by the authors (Mojac, a measure of moral orientation, and NACE, a measure of personality dimensions including empathy and narcissism), applicants completed a version of Goldberg's 'Big Five' instrument, an expanded version of the Lovibond &amp; Lovibond DASS instrument, and a reasoning test. Biographical details were also available. Analysis revealed separate 'Big Five' factors, two separate factors for moral orientation/conscience and reasoning, and a single bipolar factor involving empathy and narcissism. Implications for a dispositional theory of ethical behaviour are discussed.</p>
