<p><strong>Bore, M. R. (2002, Jul). The Libertarian-Communitarian dimension and the factor structure of morality: Evidence for a model of six moral types. Paper presented at the Inaugural International Test Users' Conference, Sydney, NSW.</strong></p>
<p>A second approach to the project initiated in 1997 by the BMed Admissions Committee at The University of Newcastle was to examine moral behaviour from the cognitive-developmental perspective. However, research by Bore (1996) found that an individual's developmental stage of moral reasoning, as measured by Kohlbergian based instruments, was only weakly related to the individual's moral decisions. A review of the major theories and measures of the field of moral psychology suggested moral orientation, rather than reasoning stage, might be more predictive of moral behaviour and that individual differences in moral orientation could be conceptualised as a Libertarian (values individual freedom) versus Communitarian (values duty to the social group) dimension. The Mojac scale was developed as a measure of the Libertarian-Communitarian dimension and data from several samples indicated acceptable reliability (Alphas ranging from .88 and .90), acceptable test-retest reliability (r = .77, 12 month interval between test and retest), and only small differences in mean scores provide by samples from Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Israel. Highly significant correlations with scores from a number of established personality measures have provided evidence of the construct validity of the Mojac scale. Factor analysis of Mojac and NACE data suggested a personality structure of morality from which a model of six moral types emerged (Bore &amp; Munro, 2000, 2001). Results from the large study in the United Kingdom, outlined in the previous paper, found that a Detached Libertarian moral type is likely to produce high scores on Eysenck's Psychoticism factor as measured by a modified version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. More generally, the relationships observed in the UK data provided further evidence of the validity of the Mojac scale, the NACE scale and the model of six moral types. While the measures have a potentially broad range of applications, the original goal of developing psychometric measures that could indicate those applicants to medical school who are likely to engage in ethically inappropriate behaviour within the practice of medicine appears to be within reach.</p>
