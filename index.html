      Medical schools around the world have a need to select their medical
      students. This is done for two reasons:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        There are always more people applying to do medicine than there are
        medical school places
      </li>
      <li>
        Medical schools want to ensure that the limited student positions
        they have available go to individuals who will make outstanding
        doctors
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Traditionally, high academic ability has been the major, if not the
      only selection criterion.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a number of reasons a selection policy based purely on academic
      marks is no longer appropriate. Firstly, there is no simple correlation
      between the level of prior academic achievement and success in health
      professional courses or later practice. Secondly, selection based solely
      on academic criteria might unreasonably discriminate against particular
      groups. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the community has
      strongly indicated a desire for graduating health practitioners who have
      a demonstrated ability to communicate with and relate to their patients,
      in addition to having the necessary highly developed levels of skill
      within their field.
    </p>

    <p>
      There has been a growing acknowledgment for some years that non-academic
      personal qualities are just as important and influential to the learning
      and practice of medicine as academic ability. Accordingly an increasing
      number of medical schools require applicants to complete tests that
      measure qualities, traits and abilities other than academic ability.
