  Medical schools around the world have a need to select their medical
  students. This is done for two reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    There are always more people applying to do medicine than there are
    medical school places, and
  </li>
  <li>
    Medical schools want to ensure that the limited student positions
    they have available go to individuals who will make outstanding
    doctors.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Traditionally, high academic ability has been the major, if not the
  only selection criterion. For a number of reasons a selection policy
  based purely on academic marks is
  <a href="http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/0142159X.2014.993600">no longer appropriate</a>.
  Firstly, there is no simple correlation between the
  level of prior academic achievement and success in health professional
  courses or later practice. Secondly, selection based solely on academic
  criteria might unreasonably discriminate against particular groups.
  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the community has strongly
  indicated a desire for graduating health practitioners who have a
  demonstrated ability to communicate with and relate to their patients,
  in addition to having the necessary highly developed levels of skill
  within their field.

<p>
  There has been a
  <a href="http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/0142159X.2015.1009023">
    growing acknowledgment for some years
  </a>
  that non-academic personal qualities are just as important and
  influential to the learning and practice of medicine as academic
  ability. Accordingly, an increasing number of medical schools require
  applicants to complete tests that measure qualities, traits and
  abilities other than academic ability.

<h3>What is the Personal Qualities Assessment?</h3>

<p>
  <span class="pqa">PQA</span> is an instrument designed to assess a range of
  personal qualities considered to be important for the study and
  practice of medicine and allied health professions. It comprises
  questions, grouped into four sections, the first to measure cognitive
  skills, the other three to measure particular personality and
  attitudinal traits relevant to health professional practice.
