<h1>
  What is the Personal Qualities Assessment?
</h1>

<p>
  <span class="pqa">PQA</span> is an instrument designed to assess a range of
  personal qualities considered to be important for the study and practice of
  medicine and allied health professions. It comprises questions grouped into
  four sections, the first to measure cognitive skills, the other three to
  measure personality and attitudinal traits relevant to health professional
  practice.

<p>
  Medical schools around the world have a need to select their medical students
  often from a very large number of applicants. Traditionally, high academic
  ability has been the major, if not the only selection criterion.
</p>

<p>
  For a number of reasons a selection policy based purely on academic marks is
  no longer appropriate
  (<a href="http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/0142159X.2014.993600">click here</a> to read more).
  Firstly, there is no simple correlation between the level of prior academic
  achievement and success in health professional courses or later practice.
  Secondly, selection based solely on academic criteria might unreasonably
  discriminate against particular groups. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
  the community has strongly indicated a desire for graduating health
  practitioners who have demonstrated personal skills, in addition to their
  advanced medical skills and knowledge
  (<a href="http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/0142159X.2015.1009023">click here</a> to read more).
</p>

<p>
  Accordingly, an increasing number of medical schools require applicants to
  complete tests that measure qualities, traits and abilities other than
  academic ability.
