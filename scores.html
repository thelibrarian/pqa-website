<h1>Test scores and interpretation</h1>

<p>
  The results for the <b>Mental Agility Test</b> are given to a medical school
  as scores that express the number of correct answers, together with an
  indication of the standard of each applicant's performance relative to norms
  calculated from samples of similar age and academic background.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, the results for the <b>Interpersonal Values Questionnaire</b>, the
  <b>Interpersonal Traits Questionnaire</b> and the <b>Personal Characteristics
  Inventory</b> are provided as three scores, with an indication of how an
  individualâ€™s responses compare to norms derived from large samples.
</p>

<p>
  Note that there are no correct answers to the questions in these three tests;
  they are designed specifically to measure:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a person's values and attitudes,</li>
  <li>aspects of their personality, and</li>
  <li>the level of honesty revealed by their responses.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Tests 2, 3 & 4 measure <b><i>Involvement</i></b> (empathy and ability to deal
  with others), <b><i>Resilience</i></b> (the capacity to work under pressure)
  and <b><i>Self-Control</i></b>.
</p>

  Health Professional Institutions may send to their applicants who complete the
