title: PQA Scores
---
<p>
  The results for the MAT are given as scores that express the number of
  correct answers. An indication of the standard of an individual's performance
  relative to norms calculated from samples of similar age and academic
  background is also given.
</p>

<p>
  The results for the Interpersonal Values Questionnaire are provided as a
  moral orientation score with lower scores indicating the tendency to value
  the rights of individuals and higher scores indicating the tendency to value
  the laws and norms of society.
</p>

<p>
  The results for the Interpersonal Traits Questionnaire and Personal
  Characteristics Inventory are separated into three traits, which provide an
  Involvement score (the higher the score the greater the empathy and
  confidence in dealing with others), a Resilience score (the higher the score
  the more able the person to work under pressure) and a Self-Control score
  (the higher the score the greater the degree of self-control).
