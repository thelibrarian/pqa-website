  Research continues into the psychology of professional ethical behaviour, and
  in particular the validity of the PQA model for the assessment and selection
  of medical and allied health professional students.

  Our research team works across faculties within the University of Newcastle
  and collaborates with a number of other universities and medical schools in
  Australia, England, Scotland, Canada, Sweden, Japan, Nepal, Taiwan, Malaysia
  and Iran.

  Potential collaborative research is planned in Hong Kong and China.
