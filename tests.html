<p>
  <b>Mental Agility Test</b> (MAT; D Munro, MR Bore &amp; DA Powis) is designed
  to measure fluid intelligence. It is a high level reasoning ability skills
  test containing questions similar to those found in many IQ tests. It is
  designed to discriminate between those of higher than average ability in this
  dimension. The test asks a series of verbal, numerical and spatial
  problem-solving questions.

</p>

<p>
  <b>Interpersonal Values Questionnaire</b> (MR Bore) describes a number of
  situations where people have to decide what to do according to their opinions
  or values. Unlike the MAT, there are no right or wrong answers to the
  questions in this test. Rather, candidates are asked to choose the answer
  that most closely reflects their value system and what they believe is
  appropriate in each situation.

</p>

<p>
  <b>Interpersonal Traits Questionnaire</b> (D Munro) presents statements about
  people and lists the way individuals might think and behave in certain
  situations. Again, there are no right or wrong answers. Instead, candidates
  are asked to indicate how true or false each statement is about themselves.

<p>
  <b>Personal Characteristics Inventory</b> (MR Bore, D Munro &amp; DA Powis)
  asks respondents to rate themselves on statements designed to establish how
  honest they are about themselves and how truthful they are about their
  thoughts, feelings and attitudes.

<h3>Assessment format, instructions and advice</h3>

<p>
  <span class="pqa">PQA</span> is available as a hard copy test, with questions
  printed in booklets, or in electronic form where candidates complete the test
  under supervised conditions at a computer terminal.
</p>

<p>
  Full instructions are given with each test. The test does not start until all
  candidates are clear about what they are expected to do. Candidates' answers
  to the test questions are made either in an OMR scannable Response Booklet or
  directly to server if the test is taken using keyboard and screen.
</p>

<p>
  Candidates do not require any specific preparation or knowledge to undertake
  <span class="pqa">PQA</span>. The questions do not test academic knowledge
  and do not require any special understanding of science. Furthermore,
  training and practice in the test items is neither necessary nor
  advantageous.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Please note that sample questions other than those shown on this website
    are NOT available.</b>

<h3>Test scores and interpretation</h3>

<p>
  The results for the MAT are given as scores that express the number of
  correct answers. An indication of the standard of an individual's performance
  relative to norms calculated from samples of similar age and academic
  background is also given.
</p>

<p>
  The results for the Interpersonal Values Questionnaire are provided as a
  moral orientation score with lower scores indicating the tendency to value
  the rights of individuals and higher scores indicating the tendency to value
  the laws and norms of society.
</p>

<p>
  The results for the Interpersonal Traits Questionnaire and Personal
  Characteristics Inventory are separated into three traits, which provide an
  Involvement score (the higher the score the greater the empathy and
  confidence in dealing with others), a Resilience score (the higher the score
  the more able the person to work under pressure) and a Self-Control score
  (the higher the score the greater the degree of self-control).
