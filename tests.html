<p>
  <span class="test-name">Mental Agility Test</span> (MAT; D Munro, MR Bore &amp; DA
  Powis) is designed to measure &ldquo;fluid intelligence&rdquo;, which is the
  ability to solve problems without relying on memory and facts learned in
  school. It contains questions similar to those found in many IQ tests,
  including verbal, numerical and spatial problem-solving questions.

<p>
  <span class="test-name">Interpersonal Values Questionnaire</span> (MR Bore)
  describes a number of situations where people have to decide what to do
  according to their opinions or values. Unlike the MAT, there are no right or
  wrong answers to the questions in this test. Rather, candidates are asked to
  choose the answer that most closely reflects their value system and what they
  believe is appropriate in each situation.

<p>
  <span class="test-name">Interpersonal Traits Questionnaire</span> (D Munro)
  presents statements about people and lists the way individuals might think and
  behave in certain situations. Again, there are no right or wrong answers.
  Instead, candidates are asked to indicate how true or false each statement is
  about themselves.

<p>
  <span class="test-name">Personal Characteristics Inventory</span> (MR Bore, D Munro &amp; DA Powis)
  asks respondents to rate themselves on statements designed to establish how
  honest they are about themselves and how truthful they are about their
  thoughts, feelings and attitudes.

<h3>Assessment format, instructions and advice</h3>

<p>
  <span class="pqa">PQA</span> is available to appropriate personnel
  (researchers and administrators) associated with medical schools or other
  academic institutions either as a hard copy test, with questions printed in
  booklets, or in electronic form, where candidates complete the test under
  supervised conditions at a computer terminal.
</p>

<p>
  Candidates' answers to the test questions are made either by filling in boxes
  in a paper response booklet using a pencil, or by pressing keys on a computer
  keyboard.
</p>

<p>
  Candidates do not require any specific preparation or knowledge to undertake
  <span class="pqa">PQA</span>. The questions do not test academic knowledge and
  do not require any special understanding of science. Furthermore, training and
  practice in the test items is neither necessary nor advantageous.
</p>

<p>
  Full instructions are given with each test. The test does not start until all
  candidates are clear about what they are expected to do.
