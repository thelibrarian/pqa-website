<p>
  <b>Mental Agility Test</b> (MAT; D Munro, MR Bore &amp; DA Powis) is designed
  to measure fluid intelligence. It is a high level reasoning ability skills
  test containing questions similar to those found in many IQ tests. It is
  designed to discriminate between those of higher than average ability in this
  dimension. The test asks a series of verbal, numerical and spatial
  problem-solving questions.

<p>
  <b>Interpersonal Values Questionnaire</b> (MR Bore) describes a number of
  situations where people have to decide what to do according to their opinions
  or values. Unlike the MAT, there are no right or wrong answers to the
  questions in this test. Rather, candidates are asked to choose the answer
  that most closely reflects their value system and what they believe is
  appropriate in each situation.

<p>
  <b>Interpersonal Traits Questionnaire</b> (D Munro) presents statements about
  people and lists the way individuals might think and behave in certain
  situations. Again, there are no right or wrong answers. Instead, candidates
  are asked to indicate how true or false each statement is about themselves.

<p>
  <b>Personal Characteristics Inventory</b> (MR Bore, D Munro &amp; DA Powis)
  asks respondents to rate themselves on statements designed to establish how
  honest they are about themselves and how truthful they are about their
  thoughts, feelings and attitudes.
